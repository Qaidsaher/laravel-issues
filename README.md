# 🐘 Laravel Issues & Solutions

Welcome to the **Laravel Issues & Solutions** repository — a curated collection of real-world Laravel problems and their verified solutions, created and maintained by **Saher Qaid**.

This repository serves as a **learning resource**, **knowledge base**, and **community hub** for developers working with Laravel. Whether you're debugging routing issues, deployment problems, or package conflicts — you'll find practical help here.

---

## 📚 What's Inside?

This repository’s **Issues** section includes:
- 🐛 Common Laravel bugs and configuration problems  
- 🔍 Clear problem descriptions and error messages  
- 🔁 Reproducible steps to trigger the issue  
- 💡 Proposed or confirmed working solutions  

Each issue is written to help others quickly identify and resolve the same problem in their own projects.

## 🎯 Purpose

Laravel is a powerful framework — but with power comes complexity. Developers often run into:
- Route conflicts or 404 errors
- Environment misconfigurations after deployment
- Versioning issues with Laravel or Composer
- Database migration challenges
- Package integration conflicts
- Performance tuning needs

Instead of solving the same issues over and over, this repository provides a **central archive** of well-documented, solved problems — shared openly with the community.
